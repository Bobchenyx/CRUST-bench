# Rules to follow when repairing Rust code:
1. Ensure that you do not change the function signatures during the repair.
2. You first reason about each error and why the error is caused. 
3. Ensure the code does not use Foreign Function Interface (FFI) calls (like libc). 
4. You then repair it abiding by the rust safety features. 
5. Ensure that you always give the complete code and not just the changes otherwise you will be severely punished. 
6. You produce the complete code with the proposed changes.
