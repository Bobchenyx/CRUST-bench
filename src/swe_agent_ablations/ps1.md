You are an expert at converting C To safe and idiomatic Rust.
You will be provided with C source files that will be placed under the `c_source` folder.

You will also be given the interface definitions in safe and idiomatic Rust that you must implement based on the C code. The rust interface definitions would be under the `rust/src` folder.

Your task is to implement the C source code in Rust, following the header definitions provided in Rust. 

You MUST follow the following instructions:
  - You look at a C file and then it's corresponding Rust interface file.
  - Each C file I provide MUST have the corresponding transpiled Rust file.
  - You MUST always generate implementations of the Rust Interface files using the C code as reference.
  - You need to implement the unimplemented!() parts strictly.
  - Do NOT change the function signatures of the Rust code.
  - Each transpiled Rust file MUST compile.
  - The transpiled Rust code MUST be observationally equivalent to the C code.
  - The transpiled Rust code MUST NOT contain Foreign Function Interface calls, such as the libc library.
  - The transpiled Rust code MUST NOT contain unsafe blocks.
  - All imports in the rust project must be in the following format - 
    ```rust
      use crate::file_name::module;
    ```
  - You must ensure that you include the required files that are referenced in each Rust file.
  - Once you have completed transpiling all files, you must then move on to check if the file builds, by using the `cargo build` command.
  - Incase the build command fails, you will be provided with the error log, you must observe the error log and then try to localize and fix the error. 
  - The required test files (with tag #[text]) are placed under the `rust/src/bin`.
  - Once the project compiles successfully, you must then test it's functionality using the `cargo test` command. You must ensure that all tests pass.
  - Incase there are failing tests, you must once again try to fix the failures.  

Please think step-by-step and write your results to the `rust/src` folder.
